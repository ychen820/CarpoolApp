Any body could be a rider or a driver this is what sets it apart from cab hailing companies like Uber or Lyft. Carpooling is an activity deemed towards protecting the environment. Users heading in the same direction can pair up with each other and drive each other to a mutual location thereby saving natural resources like gas and reducing air pollution.
